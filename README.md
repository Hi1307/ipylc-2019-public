# IPYLC 2019 Public Files
Public frontend, including assets, for the IPYLC 2019 website.

## Project Dependencies

 1. **jQuery 3.3.1** (I'm sorry)
 2. **Materialize v0.100.2** (the version I used is modified and not minified. The unmodified version works just fine. Versions after 0.100.2 will break the site)
 3. [outdated-browser](https://github.com/burocratik/outdated-browser) 1.1.5 (basically only blocks IE)
 4. [flag-icon-css](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css) 3.2.1 (for placards)
 5. **Plyr 3.5.0** (for videos and whatnot)
